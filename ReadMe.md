# me_WifiShip -- ArduinoIDE library

## Overview

Eplora. Get/set MAC, scan, connect to router, get IP.

Do it with style! I love space games (Elite, KSP), so imagine
your WiFi module is _ship_ (base type is _craft_). It has _name_ (SSID)
and _id_ (MAC). It can scan space for _stations_ (routers) to _dock_
(connect) with them.
